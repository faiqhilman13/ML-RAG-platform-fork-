  - [ ] Basic error handling and user feedback
- [x] Verify all dependencies are installed correctly

## Notes

- The system should work with or without Ollama being available
- When Ollama is not available, the system will return raw context from retrieved documents
- All errors should be handled gracefully with user-friendly messages
- The new simplified frontend should be separate from the embedded HTML UI for easier maintenance
