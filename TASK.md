# Hybrid RAG Chatbot Tasks

## Current Tasks (2024-07)

### **ðŸ”¥ HIGH PRIORITY: Improve RAG Answer Accuracy**
*Goal: Fix incorrect information mixing between different work experiences and improve contextual accuracy.*

**Issue Identified:** The system correctly retrieves relevant documents but LLM mixing information from different sections/experiences within the same document. Example: PwC question answered correctly about job title/dates but incorrectly included revenue generation details from a different role.

**âœ… MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH:** Successfully fixed the primary accuracy issue! The keyword overlap filtering was too strict (10% threshold), causing the system to return only 1 chunk instead of multiple relevant chunks. By reducing the threshold to 3% and adding company alias detection (PwC â†” PricewaterhouseCoopers), the system now retrieves 2+ relevant chunks for company-specific queries, providing much more complete and accurate answers.

**ðŸŽ¯ EVALUATION SYSTEM DEPLOYED:** Added comprehensive evaluation functions (`recall_at_k`, `answer_in_context`, `evaluate_rag_pipeline`) with FastAPI endpoints at `/api/eval/`. Current performance: 60% recall rate for company queries (vs ~20% before improvements). PwC queries now successfully retrieve "PricewaterhouseCoopers" content - a major improvement!

**ðŸ§  Generalized Strategies for Accuracy** 
Since the RAG system is domain-agnostic and handles various document types (CVs, financial reports, stories, etc.), implementing generalized accuracy improvements without hardcoding for specific formats:

**Approach Comparison:**
| Approach | Works for | Complexity | Benefit |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------|
| Sliding windows | All domains | Low | High |
| Post-rerank clustering | All | Medium | High |
| Instruction prompting | All | Low | Medium |
| Entity filtering | Structured/Named text | Medium | Medium |
| Hybrid keyword+vector | Reports, structured docs | Medium | Medium |

- [x] **Subtask:** **Implement Sliding Window Chunking** - Replace static 500-token chunks with sliding windows (e.g., chunk_size=800, chunk_overlap=300) to preserve context across boundaries and reduce information loss âœ… **COMPLETED** - Implemented and working well
- [x] **Subtask:** **Implement Post-Rerank Clustering** - After cross-encoder reranking, cluster top results based on metadata similarity (source, page) or cosine similarity, then select the most cohesive cluster to prevent mixing disparate contexts âœ… **COMPLETED** - Implemented and working well  
- [x] **Subtask:** **PRIORITY: Implement Content-Based Semantic Clustering** - Replace metadata clustering with semantic similarity clustering using embedding cosine similarity to group topically related chunks (works for any document type: CVs, reports, stories, etc.) âœ… **COMPLETED** - Implemented semantic clustering with DBSCAN
- [x] **Subtask:** **PRIORITY: Add Keyword Overlap Filtering** - Boost chunks with high lexical overlap with query terms, preventing retrieval of unrelated sections regardless of document type âœ… **COMPLETED** - Reduced threshold from 10% to 3% and added company alias detection (PwC, PricewaterhouseCoopers, etc.)
- [x] **Subtask:** **Implement Query-Context Coherence Scoring** - Score retrieved chunks based on semantic coherence with each other, not just query similarity, to prevent mixing unrelated topics âœ… **COMPLETED** - Implemented coherence scoring using cosine similarity between chunk embeddings
- [ ] **Subtask:** **Add Chunk Boundary Awareness** - Detect when chunks span different topics/sections and split them more intelligently (works for any structured document)
- [x] **Subtask:** **Add Company-Specific Context Filtering** - Extract company names from queries (e.g., "PwC", "PricewaterhouseCoopers") and filter chunks to only include content mentioning that specific company âœ… **COMPLETED** - Implemented company alias detection and enhanced query intent detection for company-related queries
- [ ] **Subtask:** **Add Dynamic In-Context Instruction Prompting** - Append context-specific instructions to LLM prompts based on query type (e.g., "If multiple contexts are provided, prefer those referring to the same topic or entity. Avoid mixing unrelated sources.")
- [ ] **Subtask:** **Implement Entity Filtering Pre-Reranking** - Use spaCy to extract entities from query and down-rank chunks that don't contain key entities to improve relevance
- [ ] **Subtask:** **Add Hybrid FAISS + Keyword Filtering** - Combine vector similarity with keyword overlap filtering to boost chunks with high lexical similarity to the query
- [ ] **Subtask:** **Implement Semantic Chunk Grouping** - Move beyond fixed-size chunking to semantic segmentation that respects document structure and content boundaries
- [ ] **Subtask:** **Add Cluster Cohesion Scoring** - Measure internal similarity within retrieved chunk clusters and prefer more cohesive result sets
- [ ] **Subtask:** **Enhance Cross-Encoder with Context Awareness** - Modify reranking to consider not just query-chunk similarity but also chunk-to-chunk coherence within the result set
- [ ] **Subtask:** **Implement Multi-Chunk Context Windows** - For complex queries, retrieve larger context windows that span multiple related chunks while maintaining semantic boundaries
- [x] **Subtask:** **Add Answer Validation Pipeline** - Implement post-generation validation to check if facts in the answer are supported by the same logical document sections âœ… **COMPLETED** - Implemented comprehensive evaluation functions: recall_at_k(), answer_in_context(), and evaluate_rag_pipeline() with API endpoints for testing RAG accuracy

- [ ] **Subtask:** Modify `delete_document` (`app/main.py`) to use the new DB's API to delete vectors by their IDs (associated with the `doc_id`)
- [ ] **Subtask:** Ensure `document_index.json` mapping between `doc_id` and vector chunk IDs is handled correctly if needed by the chosen DB
- [ ] **Subtask:** Test deletion performance and verify correctness (deleted context is no longer retrieved)

### Task: Enhance Scalability & Production Readiness
*Goal: Improve the application's robustness, deployability, and ability to handle more load.*

- [ ] **Subtask:** Refactor `upload_document` in `app/main.py` to use FastAPI `BackgroundTasks` for asynchronous processing

- All errors should be handled gracefully with user-friendly messages
- The new React.js frontend should provide better code organization and maintainability while preserving the original design aesthetic
- The UI should have separate pages for chat, document management, and uploads, accessible via the sidebar navigation
