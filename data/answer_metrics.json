This approach allows the LLM to perform certain actions, such as interacting with external APIs to retrieve information, which is a first step towards agent modeling.\n\nReAct mimics how humans operate in the real world, as we reason verbally and can take actions to gain information. It performs well against other prompt engineering approaches in a variety of domains.\n\nThe process involves combining reasoning and acting into a thought-action loop. The LLM first reasons about the problem and generates a plan of action, then performs the actions in the plan and observes the results. The LLM then uses the observations to update its reasoning and generate a new plan of action, until it reaches a solution to the problem.\n\nSources:\n9.

    "answer": "I'd be happy to help you with that! Based on the provided context, I found relevant sources discussing prompt engineering and various techniques.\n\nThe TechAI whitepaper is mentioned as a source of information on prompt engineering. According to the text, this whitepaper discusses prompt engineering in detail, including various prompting techniques to help you get started and share tips and best practices to become a prompting expert.\n\nIn particular, the whitepaper mentions that one important best practice is to provide examples within a prompt. This is highly effective because it acts as a powerful teaching tool, showcasing desired outputs or similar responses, allowing the model to learn from them and tailor its own generation accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) is also discussed as a method to automate the process of writing prompts. This method not only alleviates the need for human input but also enhances the model's performance in various tasks.\n\nTo elaborate on more prompt techniques discussed in the TechAI whitepaper, I would suggest exploring the whitepaper itself or searching for relevant online resources that provide more information on prompt engineering best practices and techniques.",
